# CellPhone-Detector
A simple mobile detector/RF signal detector was constructed using IC CA3130 and BC548.
The circuit is capable of detecting RF signals within a range of 1.5m which can be increased by using a better antenna and the LED used indicates the presence of signals by blinking at the same frequency as that of the signal.

This device is sensitive to even channelize other RF signals belonging to other devices other than cellphones like Radio.
